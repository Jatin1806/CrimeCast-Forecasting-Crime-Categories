## Project Overview
The Crime Category Prediction Challenge involves analyzing a dataset of crime incidents with the goal of predicting the type of crime based on various factors. This project leverages machine learning techniques to uncover patterns in the data and build predictive models that forecast the crime category for each incident. The project serves as a practice exercise to enhance skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on crime incidents, including incident locations, victim demographics, and other relevant attributes. Each entry represents a unique crime event, and the objective is to predict the crime category based on the provided features.

- **Source**: [Link to Dataset] (if applicable)
- **Number of Records**: X (mention the total number of rows)
- **Features**: List the key features (e.g., incident location, victim age, crime date)

## Modeling Approach
This section provides a brief overview of the modeling approach used in this project:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Describe how you handled missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- **Model Selection**: Discuss the machine learning algorithms you experimented with (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) and the rationale behind your choices.
- **Evaluation**: Explain the metrics used to evaluate the models (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, ROC-AUC) and any cross-validation techniques applied.

## Results
Summarize the key findings from your analysis, including the performance of the best model. You can include:

- Model performance metrics
- Confusion matrix and classification reports
- Insights gained from the analysis
