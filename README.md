# CrimeCast-Forecasting-Crime-Categories

## Project Overview
The Crime Category Prediction Challenge involves analyzing a dataset of crime incidents with the goal of predicting the type of crime based on various factors. This project leverages machine learning techniques to uncover patterns in the data and build predictive models that forecast the crime category for each incident. The project serves as a practice exercise to enhance skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.

The dataset used in this project contains information on crime incidents, including incident locations, victim demographics, and other relevant attributes. Each entry represents a unique crime event, and the objective is to predict the crime category based on the provided features.
